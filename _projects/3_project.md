<a href="https://mel.cgiar.org/projects/1853">SHARInG-MeD</a> is an ongoin project that aims to build an open and concerted soil monitoring scheme to understand the impact of agricultural practices on soil health in Mediterranean areas.

I am contributing to this project with the use of process-based and machine learning models to study the effect of land-use and management practices on soil health indicators.
