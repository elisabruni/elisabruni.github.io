<a href="https://holisoils.eu/">HoliSoils</a> is a H2020 project that tackles knowledge gaps on forest soil processes. I've been working on this project as a post-doc to help in the modeling of soil carbon and nitrogen cycles in European forest soils.

My work has been mainly divided into two main tasks (ongoing):
1. build and evaluate an ensemble of soil carbon models to predict the effect of forest management on soil carbon respiration. This has led to the publication of <a href="http://me4soc.geologie.ens.fr/">me4soc</a>, an open-source, user-friendly web application that can help practitioners to simulate the effect of climate, land-use and land management changes on forest soils {% cite bruni2025me4soc %}.

2. integrate microbial activity in a soil carbon and nitrogen model to understand if this can improve predictions of mineralization rates. We found that microbial biomass enhanced model performance and almost linearly controlled carbon mineralization, whereas microbial diversity had only minor and negative effects on the carbon and nitrogen mineralization rates. Check out the publication {% cite bruni2025microbial %} and this HoliSoils blog <a href="https://holisoils.eu/microbial-biomass-not-diversity-drives-soil-carbon-and-nitrogen-mineralisation/">post</a>  for more details.
